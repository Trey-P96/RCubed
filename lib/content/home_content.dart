  final String diem = ''' Update I want to go to the store.

I hate taking the time to pay for my food, walk to the car, load it into the car, drive the twenty minutes to the store, and then go in, get my groceries, pay for them, and then go back home.

And I don't think there's anything more annoying than taking those same twenty minutes to drive all the way back home just so you can go back in and get the stuff you can't wait to buy.

The good thing is that the good deals happen the next day when I go to the store.

Except this time I forgot that I'm broke and I forgot that it's Sunday and the best deals happen on Sunday.

As soon as I walked into the store and saw that they were getting ready for the big Zaycon Foods meat sale I decided that I'd buy a butt load of hamburger.

The last time I went to the store I bought enough meat to last for months and months.

I knew I wouldn't have the money this week so I just grabbed some meat off the shelf and figured I'd buy more the next time.

I saw a deal on pork butt roasts and bought two of them for 1. 88 / lb.

They were already cooked and stacked on my belt ready to go.
